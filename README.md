# Icecream Shop API

Code for an Icecream Shop's REST API, containing some example vulnerabilities.

## Tasks for week 8

1) Take some time to review the code. There is no need to clone this repository as you can do this in the browser. But feel free to make a clone if you want! Ask teh facilitator to explain any parts of the code you are unsure about.
  
2) The code contains an SQL injection vulnerability. Identify this vulnerability and write a short explanation in the main repository for this week (E.g., 8-building-securing-apps-yourusernamehere).
