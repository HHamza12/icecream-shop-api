# Icecream Shop API

Code for an Icecream Shop's REST API, containing some example vulnerabilities.

## Tasks for week 9

1) Take some time to review the code. There is no need to clone this repository as you can do this in the browser. But feel free to make a clone if you want! Ask the facilitator to explain any parts of the code you are unsure about.
  
2) The code contains a misconfiguration type vulnerability. A secret has been exposed. Identify this vulnerability and write a short explanation in the main repository for this week.
